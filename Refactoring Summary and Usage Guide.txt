# CLI Module Refactoring Summary

## New Structure

I've broken down the original `cli.py` file into the following modular components:

1. **cli_main.py**: Core CLI functionality
   - Contains the main CLI class
   - Handles the main menu and application flow
   - Manages application startup and shutdown

2. **cli_utils.py**: Utility functions
   - Terminal control functions
   - Formatting helpers
   - Shared helper functions

3. **cli_sources.py**: Source management
   - Adding new sources
   - Editing existing sources
   - Deleting sources

4. **cli_health.py**: Health check configuration
   - Configuring health check settings
   - Starting/stopping health monitoring

5. **cli_status.py**: Status dashboard
   - Real-time monitoring view
   - System resource statistics
   - Source activity monitoring

6. **__init__.py**: Package initialization
   - Makes the CLI class available as a package import

## Benefits of this Refactoring

1. **Modularity**: Each file has a clear, focused responsibility
2. **Maintainability**: Easier to find and modify specific functionality
3. **Readability**: Shorter files are easier to understand
4. **Extensibility**: New features can be added without modifying existing code
5. **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different components

## Usage

The refactored CLI module is used exactly the same way as before. The main entry point remains the `CLI` class, which is now imported from the `log_collector.cli_main` module.

To instantiate the CLI:

```python
from log_collector.cli_main import CLI

cli = CLI(source_manager, processor_manager, listener_manager, health_check)
cli.start()
```

Or simply:

```python
from log_collector import CLI

cli = CLI(source_manager, processor_manager, listener_manager, health_check)
cli.start()
```

All the original functionality is preserved, just organized into more manageable pieces.

## Implementation Notes

1. **Function Parameters**: When the CLI class methods were converted to standalone functions, they now receive the required manager objects and CLI instance as parameters.

2. **Header Printing**: The header printing function is duplicated in both `cli_main.py` and `cli_status.py` to avoid circular imports, as both modules need this functionality.

3. **Terminal State**: Terminal settings are managed carefully throughout to ensure proper cleanup even in case of errors.

4. **Cross-module References**: Functions from `cli_utils.py` are imported by other modules to maintain shared functionality.

## How to Modify Specific Components

- **To change the main menu**: Modify `_show_main_menu()` in `cli_main.py`
- **To change source management**: Modify functions in `cli_sources.py`
- **To change health check options**: Modify functions in `cli_health.py`
- **To enhance the status dashboard**: Modify `view_status()` in `cli_status.py`
- **To add utility functions**: Add them to `cli_utils.py`

This modular structure makes it much easier to locate and modify specific parts of the CLI functionality without having to navigate through a single large file.
